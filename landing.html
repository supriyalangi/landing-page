          <h1>OUR STORY<br>WE STAND IN WHAT WE STAND FOR</h1>
          <h2>The Founder NICK</h2>
          <p> Deeply aware of climate change issues, and motivated to try and make a difference, he
            investigated the use
            of recycled plastic bottles in creating shoes. Using his 3D printers, he figured out how to make
            the midsoles
            out of rPET, but the uppers were a problem â€“ they needed to be comfortable. He went to Hong Kong
            and connected
            with another youth who had a patent on 3D knitting. The technology worked beautifully and Nick
            found what he
            needed to launch Unis, a 3D printed fashion sneaker line that was good looking, good fitting,
            and good for the
            environment.

            Now, Nick knows that our generation has the power to conquer whatever we set out to accomplish.
